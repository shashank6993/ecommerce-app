## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Node.js**: Required for local development (optional for Docker-only usage).
- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following (values provided in your configuration):

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{CLERK_SECRET_KEY}}
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET={{CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET}}

# Database
DATABASE_URL={{DATABASE_URL}}

# Stripe
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY={{STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET={{STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET}}

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL={{NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}}

# Email.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID={{NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID={{NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_USER_ID={{NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_USER_ID}}
```

## Setup and Running with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create `.env` File**:
   Copy the environment variables above into a `.env` file in the project root.

3. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
   Run the following command to build the application, set up the database, run migrations, seed the database, and start the app:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   - This command builds the Docker images, starts the containers, and runs the app on `http://localhost:3000`.
   - The database is initialized with the Prisma migrations and seeded with sample data (`prisma/seed.ts`).

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
   - The PostgreSQL database is accessible on `localhost:5432` (if needed for debugging).
   - Setup the Ngrok with `http http://localhost:3000` so it would give the live url and paste it to clerk webhook with as `"Ngrok URL"/api/webhooks/clerk`
      - Example as `https://3db7-2401-4900-a15a-9e90-f002-acd8-1d1f-dcdc.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/clerk`
      - For this you need to setup the clerk and in webhook select user all events
   - Setup the stripe cli by
     -  First install stripe cli and run `stripe login` then login
     - Then run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` for the webhook and add to `.env`
   - Then after adding clerk webhook and stripe webhook now run the application
  
5. "Setup the the database"
   - Run command `npx prisma generate` for generate the migration for the machine
   - Run command `npx prisma migrate dev` and `npx prisma db push` for populating database with tables
   - Run command `npm run prisma-seed` for seeding the database make sure you run setup command before seeding 
   

5. **Stop the Application**:
   To stop and remove the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

   To also remove the database volume:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

## Development (Optional)

For local development without Docker:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run Prisma migrations:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

3. Seed the database:

   ```bash
   npm run prisma-seed
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
